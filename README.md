# Film and Series Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

This project demonstrates how to build a recommendation system for films and series using collaborative filtering techniques and Python. The goal is to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** The project uses a dataset containing user ratings and reviews for various films and series.
- **Notebook:** The `DataCleaningWithRegression.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook contains code for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- **Overview:** The `README.md` file provides a concise overview of the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn.
2. **Run the Notebook:** Open and execute the `DataCleaningWithRegession.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.

## Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Read the dataset and explore its structure and contents.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for modeling.
3. **Collaborative Filtering:** Implement collaborative filtering algorithms such as User-Based and Item-Based approaches.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the recommendation system's performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Generating Recommendations:** Develop a mechanism to generate personalized recommendations for users.

## Important Notes

- Basic understanding of Python programming and recommendation system concepts is recommended.
- Run the code in an environment with the required libraries and dependencies.
